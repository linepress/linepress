# Crystalizing the project goals

Provide a project structure standard so all projects look and feel the same only with different flavours. The cookies stay the same shape.

## Things of the past

* annoying plugin activation for project code when it's in a plugin
* endless searching ans switching between plugin and theme
* multiple context instances when using plugin and theme for a project
* no more deprecated functions in un-updatetable plugins and themes
* big coding style and architecture differences between projects
